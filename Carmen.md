The voices around me whisper and whine, yet they never end.

The birds sing some dull song that sounds as if it is intended to give me a headache.

I wish they would shut the fuck up, all I want is to hear the ocean.

"How much farther?"

I ask.

My voice shakes.

The little bit of saliva that touches my lips feels gritty and there's a tingling in my mouth I don't like.

"I'm sorry, what?"

Carmen comes up beside me and takes my hand, trying to get me to stop shaking.

"You said five more miles, how much farther?"

"It's not five miles, it's just that I need to go up this hill before we can walk down it," she says.

She takes my other hand, holds it in both of hers, and then gives me a little shake.

"It's OK.

I can't carry you."

I'm thinking to myself that I could, but I don't.

Even if I could, I wouldn't.

"I can walk," I say, my voice rising.

"If I really had to I could."

"Hold on to me, OK?"

"Don't you dare drop me."

"Are you being funny?"

"No, I'm serious."
"Are you saying you'd rather be a pansy than stay with me?

Is that what you're saying?"

"Yes."

"OK, then."

She lets go of my hands and takes a step back.

"Let's go."

As we start up the hill, I can hear her steps.

There is no doubt about it, her heels are taking her to the top.

I try to match them, even if it is only a few steps.

When we reach the crest of the hill, Carmen turns to me.

"There are two roads that lead to Barra de Navidad.

The left way is shorter but more dangerous.

Follow me on this one."

"But I don't want to, I want to go to Barra."

"Please."

She turns and starts down the hill, taking one or two steps at a time.

I go with her.

It's not easy.

I use my arms to balance me, pulling myself down the steep hill.

It's not a graceful or easy task.

In fact, the harder I pull, the faster I go.

The beach is in front of me.

Carmen gets further and further ahead, not saying anything.

I'm getting desperate, the beach is so close and yet so far away.

When I realize I am no longer catching up to her, I start to feel the panic.

I'm losing her.

I am getting more afraid than I have ever been in my life.

I turn to find her, to ask what's going on.

My hands fly up in front of my face, begging her to stop.

But she doesn't stop.

I yell, hoping that she'll hear me, even if she doesn't come back to me.

A few minutes go by and then I see her run up behind me.

"Stop," she yells, her heels nearly tripping me.

"Why are you stopping?"

"Why are you stopping?" she yells back.

"You know I can't."

She grabs my hand.

I think I hear her heels click.

"Come on," she says.

"It's a lot shorter if you walk the way I do."

"Fine," I holler.

"But be careful."

"Don't worry about me."

And she pushes me, not lightly but with force, as if I am made of lead.

There is no time to really process what is happening.

I start to stumble and fall forward, collapsing onto the sand and dropping the sandals I am wearing.

"What are you doing?"

I hear myself screaming.

"What are you doing?"

"You're going to get sand in my shoe," she yells back.

I struggle to my feet and start to pull the sand out of my shoe.

My sandals are filled with fine, powdery, gray, beach sand.

I fill my hand with it, show it to Carmen, and then throw it at her.

She recoils, flings her sandals to the side, and takes off running.

I chase after her, yelling as loudly as I can.

"Carmen!"

She pauses and looks back at me.

"Don't you dare, Carmen!

Don't you dare!

Don't you dare!"

"Listen!"

I cry.

"I need to explain!"

And before I can say another word, she has spun around and is running toward the mangroves, the ones that are called los manganos.

I'm beside myself, hysterically screaming for her.

"Carmen!

Carmen!

Carmen!

Don't you leave me!"

She doesn't stop, she doesn't even turn.

She just keeps on running.

She runs until she can't run anymore and then she falls to the sand.

I start to panic.

She hasn't stopped, and it's getting darker and darker.

When I hear a voice I recognize as my mother's, I don't even think.

I just turn and try to run toward her.

"Carmen!"

I call out again.

"It's me!"

"I'm fine," I yell.

"We got separated, I'm on the island, it's safe."

My mother's eyes are filled with sadness.

I can see my words have hurt her.

"I'll go find her, mom," I say, and then take off toward the sea, not thinking about what I'm doing.

I make my way along the water's edge, doing what I think I know, where I know she's going.

She can't get that far away from me.

And then I see her.

And then I'm running toward her, and she is on her knees, crying, and screaming Carmen's name over and over.

I get to Carmen and I fall to my knees.

My hands go out toward her, wanting to pull
