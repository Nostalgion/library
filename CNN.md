Knock knock. Who's there? CNN! CNN who? CNN who? Everybody... CNN and Friends! You talking about? Can you speak up? Can you talk to me? Can you tell me what's going on? CNN's Dan Merica... was attacked for trying to interview --

CAMP: What is going on? What's going on?

CNN didn't make the rules. It didn't set them. We didn't think we were gonna get this kind of money. There is absolutely no news value to having a story about anti-Trump conservatives harassed by the Secret Service because of it. We thought, who would be willing to pay for such an interview?

Do I know every conservative who is doing that? No. Am I always on the side of the conservatives? No, sometimes I'm on the side of the leftist left wingers.

Do I believe it is real? Yes. Do I believe the government is covering it up? Yes, I do believe that.

Via The Daily Caller:

Despite what the media says, this is absolutely real. Anti-Trump Trump supporters have been harassed and have even been shot at. Since the election, Breitbart has documented more than 20 of these crimes. However, this story from the government, released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), is the first we've heard that the Secret Service paid a hit-man $50,000 to kill a blogger.

Dan Merica was a young DC blogger who would often use his position to ask President Trump questions. This week, The Daily Caller was contacted by the Secret Service asking for comment regarding anti-Trump emails sent to Merica's employer, The Hill, from the email account of John Jones, who has been previously identified by prosecutors as a hacker and an ISIS supporter. Merica asked the Secret Service if they were aware of the emails. According to TheDC, the agency responded, "Mr. Merica was not the subject of an investigation and the USSS is not aware of any investigation into this matter." The response did not clarify if Merica's employer was investigated. The Secret Service has since claimed that Merica's email account was hacked and not a part of the Jones investigation.

CAMP: I didn't expect this to come out that way. I thought they would say, hey, we're gonna investigate, what is the story? We're gonna figure out if it's a security breach, that maybe he shouldn't have been doing this. I'm not saying he shouldn't have been doing this, but I'm not saying he should have been murdered. I wasn't thinking that the Secret Service was gonna, well, can you hold a rifle over Dan's head? Is that what they are going to do, is that what they did? I didn't think that at all. I was like what? Are you serious? I would never think they would do that. What happened is that they were hacked, they are trying to explain, but it's kind of obvious what's going on. Now, do I think they did it? I don't know. I do think they were hacked because that's an attack. That's an attack on any journalist. It is an attack on any news organization.

When I see CNN's executives holding their noses and bringing on neo-Nazis who want to fight or anything like that, I'm like, what's the matter with you? Do you think your viewers are that dumb? Or that they want to know these things? Or do you think you can just lock that stuff up and tell it like it is and not take advantage of that? Do you think that's an honest way to do business? It's not. I don't think any news organization should. No, I don't like it. I don't like it. It shouldn't happen. I don't think it's fair. I think it shouldn't happen to any journalist.

CAMP: I'll tell you what, the media, this is very important. I think a lot of this stuff is, I feel like, a lot of the media and the political elite or the elite of both parties or whatever you want to call them, they want to cover the stories that are sellable.
